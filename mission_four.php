<p>First United Methodist church believes is bringing youth into a personal relationship 
	with Jesus; therefore, we support Youth for Christ in several ways. Financially we 
	support YFC South Central Kansas, Greensburg Community Youth, Tony & Deb Factor (YFC Staff) 
	and Whitney Kregar (Mentoring Program).  We pray regularly for their ministry; some members 
	serve as mentors for individual youth.</p>

	<p>YFC's goal is to reach unsaved youth for Jesus. They reach out to youth in a variety of ways 
		and earn the right to be heard by them. One way is through their donuts and candy bar ministries 
		where they make connections, learn names, and start to build relationships. Weekly Campus Life 
		meetings with games, food, loud music and lively discussions are another way YFC staff reaches 
		out to youth. This becomes and entry point for unchurched youth. Taking trips with youth is 
		another way to get to know them better. YFC takes youth to concerts, camp, youth conferences and 
		on missions trips.</p>
