          <h2 class="featurette-heading">Terry Mayhew</h2>
          <p class="lead">In March 1994 Pastor Terry Mayhew and his wife Mary made the decision to close the business they had operated for 14 years. After much discussion and prayer, Pastor Terry finally answered God's call to full time pastoral ministry and Mary began to embrace the call of a pastor's wife becoming involved in each church and community.</p>
          <p class="lead">On June 1, 1994, Pastor Terry began serving Trinity United Methodist Church in Jewell, Kansas where he served for 9 years. During this time he also completed an associates degree at Cloud County Community College and the seminary work for course of study. He was ordained in May 2012 at the Kansas West Annual Conference. This same year daughter Renae graduated from Hutchinson Junior College and son and wife graduated from Sterling College.</p>
          <p class="lead">In July 2003 Pastor Terry was appointed to serve the Plains and Kismet United Methodist churches where he served for 4 years. At the time of this move both communities had sustained damage from hail and flooding so right from the start there was repair to do both physically and spiritually.</p>
          <p class="lead">On May 4, 2007 Pastor Terry received a call from t he District Superintendent with a request to be reassigned to the Greensburg United Methodist Church. This call came as the EF5 tornado was ripping through Greensburg. Both Pastor Terry and Mary agreed to accept this appointment and began serving the First UMC on September 1, 2007. This has been both a challenging and rewarding appointment. God has richly blessed the church, community and Pastor and Terry. They hope to continued serving this church till retirement.</p>
