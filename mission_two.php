<p>Nathan and Amy visit in the homes, churches and communities around them. 
	They lead Bible study groups and serve in whatever ways God calls them. 
	Nathan taught at a district youth camp and many commitments were made. 
	Amy interpreted for a group of eye doctors and assistance from the US and Canada.</p>

	<p>This opened several doors for her to pray with people and to lend a helping hand to those in need. 
		Nathan and Amy asked that we pray for their eyes to open to see what divine appointments (opportunities) 
		God has for them and that those who have made commitments to receive Christ will grow in faith.</p>
